### The project would gather weather data for a specified location over the course of several days. It would then analyze this data to identify the days with the best weather conditions for a picnic.

## Specifically, the project would look for days with the following conditions:

- Temperatures between 60-85Â°F
- Low humidity levels
- Little to no chance of rain
- Plenty of sunshine

### Once the best days have been identified, the project could present the user with a list of the most suitable days and their respective weather conditions. The user could then choose the day that works best for them and plan their picnic accordingly.
